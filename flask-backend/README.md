# Quickstart

Before running shell commands, set the FLASK_APP and FLASK_DEBUG environment variables

```bash
export FLASK_APP=/path/to/spot-a-song.py
export FLASK_DEBUG=1
```

Then run the following commands to bootstrap your environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Polvyer/Spot-A-Song.git
cd spot-a-song
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the following commands to create your app's database tables and perform the initial migration

```bash
flask db init
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade
```

To run the web application use:

```bash
flask run --with-threads
```

# Deployment

In your production environment, make sure the FLASK_DEBUG environment variable is unset or is set to 0, so that ProdConfig is used, and set DATABASE_URL which is your mysql URI for example mysql://localhost/example (this is set by default in heroku).

# Shell 

To open the interactive shell, run

```bash
flask shell

By default, you will have access to the flask app and models.

# Migrations

Whenever a database migration needs to be made. Run the following commands

```bash
flask db migrate
```

This will generate a new migration script. Then run

```bash
flask db upgrade
```
To apply the migration

For a full migration command reference, run flask db --help.
